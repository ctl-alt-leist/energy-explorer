# CA Energy Storage and Capacity: Exploratory Data Analysis

This project is a Python-based analysis of Californiaâ€™s energy storage data. The accompanying presentation for this work
is located in `docs/` as both a PowerPoint and PDF.

## Installation and Environment

This project makes us of [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage the dependencies and the environment. Once
Poetry is installed, the environment used to develop this project may be recreated and activated according to the
following steps:

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies, which can be seen in the `pyproject.toml`. Install
Poetry, then set up the project.

Install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
poetry shell
```

To run a script without activating the environment, use:

```bash
poetry run python notebook/<script_name>.py
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following set directories, which organizes the Python code into two categories - the
"toolbox" shared across multiple analyses and the "workbench" where executable scripts are stored.

- *energy_explorer/*: A set of modules combined into a single python package - the "toolbox".
- *notebook/*: A set of executable scripts which perform the analyses - the "workbench".
- *data/*: The original and modified data sets from which the analyses are derived.
- *figures/*: Where the output figures are written and organized.
- *docs/*: Additional information.

## The Executables (Analysis)

The various components of the EDA and model analyses live in the scripts in `notebook/`. Each one has modifyable
components (mostly in the form of CONST variable types) which modify how the data is selected and code is run.

- chart_fuel_types.py: Generates charts to visualize different fuel types and their capacities.
- clean_dataframe.py: Prepares and cleans the energy storage data for analysis.
- map_energy_storage.py: Plots geographic locations of energy storage facilities on a map.
- run_capacity_series.py: Analyzes and plots capacity time series data for selected energy storage systems.
- run_correlations.py: (**INCOMPLETE**) Calculates correlations between acceleration patterns of different energy
  storage systems.
- run_similarity.py: Computes similarity scores between capacity growth rates and predicts future trends based on
  similar patterns.

More directly, to see the final resulting analysis, please execute the `notebook/run_similarity.py` script.  This
produces two figures which are discussed in the presentation slides.

```bash
poetry run python notebook/run_similarity.py
```
